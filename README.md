## Here I Work On:
##  House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

The main aim of this project is to predict the house price based on various features which we will discuss as we go ahead

#### Dataset to downloaded from the below link
https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data

##  I worked on three differnt areas:
  ## 1. Data Analysis
  ## 2. Feature Engineering
  ## 3. Feature Scaling
  ## 4. Feature Selection 
  
  # In Data Analysis I will Analyze To Find out the below stuff:
1. Missing Values
2. All The Numerical Variables
3. Distribution of the Numerical Variables
4. Categorical Variables
5. Cardinality of Categorical Variables
6. Outliers
7. Relationship between independent and dependent feature(SalePrice)

# Feature Engineering:
We will be performing all the below steps in Feature Engineering

1. Missing values
2. Temporal variables
3. Categorical variables: remove rare labels
4. Standarise the values of the variables to the same range
